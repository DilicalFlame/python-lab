# Python Playground
This repository is a collection of Python scripts and projects 
that serve as a playground for experimenting with various Python features, 
libraries, and concepts.

I am using uv package manager with python 3.12 virtual environment 
with this repository.

```bash
uv sync # Run this to get in par with the latest changes in the repository.
```

## Folder Structure
The repository is organized into directories that categorize the scripts 
based on their functionality and the Python concepts they demonstrate. 
Each directory contains scripts that are related to a specific topic or library.
